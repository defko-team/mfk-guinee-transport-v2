### Please use modularity when adding your stuffs  

### Please don't put comment in the code until it is very needed : make your code fully understandable and it will be ok.

### At least add a docstring !

=> create or add your class / file into the appropriate module

### Naming convention

=> Camel case for variable names : example isAuthticated

=> Camel case for function names : example getUserDetails()

=> Pascal case for class names and widgets : example HomeScreen

=> Snake case (Uppercased) for constants : example DEFAULT_TIMEOUT

=> Snake case (Lowercased) for file names : example user_profile.dart


### Check packages and usage here : https://pub.dev/packages

### Note : at the end of the project run flutter clean to remove all unused dependencies
